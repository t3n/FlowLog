This package adds a few helper to log Flow Messages.

ðŸ”§ Still Work in Progress ðŸ”§

## ConsoleStorage

If you'd like to log your Exceptions to the console, for instance stderr or stdout, he ConsoleStorage is for you.
It will log all throwables directly to the console as JSON. The JSON is formatted to be [parsed by google Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.events/report#ReportedErrorEvent).

To enable the ConsoleStorage you need to adjust your Settings.yaml like this:

```yaml
Neos:
  Flow:
    log:
      throwables:
        storageClass: t3n\FlowLog\ThrowableStorage\ConsoleStorage
        optionsByImplementation:
          't3n\FlowLog\ThrowableStorage\ConsoleStorage':
            streamName: 'stderr'
```

The StreamName could either be `stderr` or `stdout`.

You can also set the ServiceContext that is used by StackDriver:
```yaml
t3n:
  FlowLog:
    serviceContext:
      service: 'flow-app'
      version: 'master'

```
